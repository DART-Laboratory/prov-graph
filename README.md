# Zeek-Agent Visualizer
Zeek-Agent Visualizer is a web-based graph visualization tool that allows secrity analysts to construct, explore and manipulate provenance graphs
interactively for better threat alert investigation. This tool is designed to construct provenance graphs from kernel-level audit logs in a way that does not only assist in observing the behaviour of an attack, but also trace the attack from one endpoint e.g a compromised file to the other endpoint e.g the first process that was created due to the attack.

User friendly manipulation techniques of such a graph can also allow analysts to observe other compromises that they might not be aware of.

## Configuration

The displayed nodes and links are derived from the audit logs from Zeek-Agent (attach github link) which contains process, socket, file, network, and attribution of socket with network events. Each of these events are stored in a seperate json log file.

To use Zeek-Agent Visualizer you need to be connected to elasticsearch running with ajax API that is configured for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and a recent web browser to display the visualization. 

Each index in elasticsearch should have only one log file entry, each document in the table corresponds to a seperate log from a log file (e.g process.log containing process events).

For example the url: 'http://localhost:9200/file_index/_doc' will have 'file_index' as an index storing file event logs

**Note: You must not manipulate any log entries in an index such as adding an id or timestamp.**

Lastly, on your browser, just access the 'graphexp.html' file

## Features

Zeek-Agent Visualizer offers many features that were designed while keeping in mind the needs of an analyst tracing an attack or observing a potential attack behaviour through this Visualizer.

### Search
There are multiple ways to search and display nodes.

1)You can search on unique ids of process, file, socket, and zeek labels (nodes) assigned by elasticsearch

2)You can search on file name

3)You can search on process PID

When searching on any of the above node key, make sure the label filter is 'none' or corresponds to the label being searched. for example while searching for file name, the node label must be either 'none' or 'file' to display the corresponding node. By default the node label is 'none'.

If you do not know value of any of the above mentioned fields, then you can search on the basis of labels (process,socket,file,zeek) and all the nodes within a certain limit specified will be displayed. This can help give an analyst a good reference node that can be then specifically searched.

When searching solely on the basis of labels, ensure that the key value input field is empty

### Node and edge information+exploration
Clicking on a node forms a circle around the node, and its parent and child nodes are displayed, opening new paths for exploration.

The label of each node is displayed when the cursor is hovered over the node. Upon clicking the node, all the relevant information regarding that node is displayed on the right side. Two nodes are connected with an edge with a label that defines the action of the parent node that led to the creation of child node e.g a syscall or the label can be a general relationship between the nodes.![zeek_exploration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74818361/136701050-fe5b5d85-2ce9-4f23-8aa2-dcc842f6a819.gif)


The graph is mostly explored in such a way that the parent node is displayed on the left side of the clicked node, and the child node is displayed on the right side of the clicked node. This helps to see the chain of events in time from left to right.


### Limit the number of nodes
Since provenance graphs of system logs have the potential to generate millions of new nodes, it can overwhelm an analyst if displayed on an interface. Therefore, you can limit the number of entries that are displayed for each label from Result limit which is set on 30 by default. The default number can be changed from 'graphexp.html'.

Moreover, in the 'GraphConf.js' file you can also change the number of nodes that you want to retrieve from elastic search aswell as number of nodes you want to display for each label.

### Layering
 

Our visualization tool uses the concept of layers of visualization, which aims to put a spotlight on certain subgraphs rather than displaying the
whole graph during exploration. In this idea, if a user clicks a vertex, the visualizer will show
its neighbors, expanding new layers (paths) for further exploration. While if a vertex is not
clicked, then that vertex and its corresponding edges will slowly vanish as we progress in the exploration.

If the nodes completely vanish in the process, they can no longer be clicked, however, upon clicking a node that is vanishing, it and its neighbours become active and therefore bright again. A vanished node can come back to life again in the same position it was vanished at, if any of its neighbour is clicked. Layering can therefore help provide a precise, local view rather than a global one.

Zeek-Agent Visualizer also allows the user to control how many new layers can be explored before vanishing old layers.

.
### Merging

Zeek-Agent Visualizer uses the concept of merging similar nodes into a single node. This significantly
reduces the size of the graph without affecting the correctness of causal analysis.

### Pinning a node

Some nodes are more important than others and the user would not want them to vanish in the layering process, or would want to mark them for reference. You can do this by clicking on the small circle on the upper right side of the node. By pinning it, the node will never vanish unless you unpin it.


### Dynamic Positioning of nodes using d3.js

Zeek-Agent Visualizer relies on D3.js library for positioning of nodes. D3â€™s force layout uses a physics based simulator for positioning the visual elements of the graph. It simulates forces which allow you to control the position of nodes in relation to each other and the simulation. D3 forces can allow nodes to attract to repel and attract one another, nodes can be configured to attract to center of gravity. Moreover, a collision detection mechanism can prevent nodes to overlap one another. These are just some of the many options D3 offers to visualize a data set.

Since the simulation is aimed at visualizing the new nodes that were not previously part of the graph. In order to prevent overlapping of these new nodes with the old ones, Zeek-Agent Visualizer finds a the closest positions for new nodes that have not been taken by any older node(s) along the x-axis.



### Freeze exploration

Zeek-Agent Visualizer allows users to 'freeze' the graph at any time. This allows the users to click on the nodes and see its description without making it explore and display its neighbouring nodes.

### Hide nodes


The tool allows users to hide particular type of nodes so that they can focus on the more relevant type of nodes as per their requirement. For example, a user can hide all file nodes if it is not of interest to them. The graph will continue to explore the hidden node type(s) but will only display them if they choose to unhide them.

































# Graphexp: graph explorer with D3.jslol

Graphexp is a lightweight web interface to explore and display a graph stored in a Gremlin graph database, via the Gremlin server (version 3.2.x, 3.3.x or 3.4.x).

Graphexp is under the Apache 2.0 license.

![graphexp](https://github.com/bricaud/graphexp/blob/master/images/graphexp2018.png "Graph exploration")


 A version of Graphexp with the same backend but a nicer UI (using bootstrap) is available at [github.com/erandal/graphexp](https://github.com/erandal/graphexp). You can try it out and give some feedback in issue [#39](https://github.com/bricaud/graphexp/issues/39).
 

## Configuration

To use Graph Explorer, you need a [Gremlin server](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/) running with REST or websocket protocol and a *recent* web browser to display the visualization.
On your web browser, just access the file `graphexp.html`.

Next step, configure the server settings on the bottom of the page. The default Gremlin server address is `localhost:8182`. You will have to specify the communication protocol `websocket` or `REST` and the gremlin server version. Graphexp is not able to handle secure connections yet and a contribution on this topic would be welcome.

Graphexp works with [Amazon Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune). With this database, set `SINGLE_COMMANDS_AND_NO_VARS = true` in the file `graphConf.js`. if you use REST over `https` you may need to set `REST_USE_HTTPS = true` as well.

Additional parameters can be configured inside the file `graphConf.js`.

**New** : GraphExp has now curved links and can display multiple edges between 2 nodes. Thanks to a contribution from [agussman](https://github.com/agussman). This is the default, you can still come back to straight edges by setting `use_curved_edges = false` in `graphConf.js`.

## Getting started

### Installing a Gremlin server

If you have not yet installed a gremlin server, download the last release of the [Gremlin server](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/) and follow the [documentation](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-server). In the server folder just run
```
bin/gremlin-server.sh conf/gremlin-server-rest-modern.yaml
```
or on windows
```
bin/gremlin-server.bat conf/gremlin-server-rest-modern.yaml
```
This default server comes with a small graph database of 6 nodes.
The server should start on port `8182`. Replace `gremlin-server-rest-modern.yaml` by `gremlin-server-modern.yaml` if you want to use websocket.


Alternatively, if you have Docker installed on your machine, you may run a Docker container with an already configured Gremlin server. You can find one on [this page](https://hub.docker.com/r/bricaud/gremlin-server-with-demo-graph/). This server has a graph database containing a demo graph: the tree of life, with 35960 nodes and 35959 edges. You can download it and run it using
```
docker pull bricaud/gremlin-server-with-demo-graph
docker run -p 8182:8182 -it --name gremlin-server-rest bricaud/gremlin-server-with-demo-graph
```
or for the websocket version:
```
docker pull bricaud/gremlin-server-with-demo-graph:websocket
docker run -p 8182:8182 -it --name gremlin-server-websocket bricaud/gremlin-server-with-demo-graph:websocket
```
### Running a graphexp Demo with Docker

You may also try out a Graphexp demo on [joov's Github repository](https://github.com/joov/gremlin-demo). It uses Docker compose and can work on Windows.  

### Graphexp guidelines
To get some first visualization of your graph, you may click on the `Search` button, without filling any box. Graphexp will then send a query to the graph DB, asking for the first 50 nodes and their edges.

The node and edge properties can be automatically retrieved using the `get graph info` button. Pushing this button will also display some graph properties on the left side of the page. If it is not the case, check your configuration, it means Graphexp can not query the graphDB. To get the properties, Graphexp should consider all the nodes and edges. This may be overwhelming for the server if the graph is very large. A limit to the 10000 first nodes and edges is set to avoid that. You may change it in `graphConf.js` with the parameter `limit_graphinfo_request`.

When a node of the visualization is clicked, it will become 'active' with a circle surrounding it and its information will be displayed on the right side of the page. Moreover, this action will trigger the display of its neighbors.
Clicking on an edge will show its properties (without highlighting the edge). 

When appearing for the first time the nodes will be positioned following a force layout. Drag and drop can be used to pin them in a particular position. Once dragged the nodes will stay at their position. Drag and drop is allowed only for the nodes on the active layer (most recent layer) with no connection with nodes in other layers. See "Visualization concepts" section for more information on the layers.

### Querying the graphDB
In the top bar, you can search the graphDB to display a particular node or group of nodes. 

* The box `Node label` allows to filter nodes with a particular label during the search. 
* The box `Node property`, in combination with the `Property value` box, allows to find nodes with a particular keyword or value in their properties. The `Type of search` allows for a perfect (equals) or partial match (Contains). *Note that the 'contains' option will only work with Janusgraph*.
* The box `Traverse by edge` acts directly in the interactive visualization. If an edge label is entered in the box, clicking on a node will only display its neighbors connected with that type of edge label.
* The `Results limit` is here to avoid overwhelming the visualization. It fixes the maximal le number of nodes to display per query.
* If `Freeze exploration` is ticked, the graph displayed will stay the same even if nodes are clicked on. It is useful when you just need to display the node properties.
* `Number of layers` is explained below in the "Visualization concept" section.

Note that the input is case-sensitive.

### URL query string parameters

* `ts` specifies [TraversalSource](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#the-graph-process) in case of multiple different graphs stored in the same database. If unspecified, the default is just `g`. For Example `http://localhost:8183/graphexp.html?ts=gTreeOfLife` replaces `g` by `gTreeOfLife` in all the gremlin queries (for example `g.V()` becomes `gTreeOfLife.V()`). 

### Editing the graph

There is now the possibility to add/edit the vertices and edges of the graph. A small button was added by [sandecho](https://github.com/sandecho) at the bottom `Edit Graph`. You can modify your graph using Graphexp but you have to update the view to see the result. You can check if the modification has been taken into account by the server in the message window on the top right of the interface.

## Visualization concept

The visualization is based on a concept of layers of visualization. The idea is to progress in the graph as in a jungle. The clicked node immediately shows its neighbors, opening new paths for the exploration. If not clicked, a node vanishes little by little as we progress in the exploration. Coming back during the exploration is allowed. Before it completely disappears, a node can be clicked and will become active again.
This visualization concept is aimed at providing a precise, local view rather than a global one.

During your exploration, you can set up milestones by clicking on the small circle on the upper right side of a node. This will pin the node in time, preventing it from disappearing.

You may also freeze the exploration, by ticking the appropriate checkbox. The evolution of the exploration will stop, allowing to gather information on the nodes displayed, without displaying their neighbors.

## Node and edge information

The Id and label of each node can be displayed by hovering the cursor over the node. The full information on the properties is displayed on the right of the page when clicking on the node or edges. Once the `get graph info` button has been clicked, a choice of properties to display appears on the left side.

## Node color

If a node property called 'color' exists in the node properties with a hexadecimal color code (string), it will be displayed automatically on the graph. Otherwise, the default node color can be set in the `graphConf.js` file.  The node color can be set interactively after the `get graph info` button has been pressed. A select tab appears on the left sidebar allowing to set the color according to one of the property values present in the graph.

## Predefined node positions

Graphexp can display nodes at specific positions if they are stored in the DB. For that, modify `node_position_x` and `node_position_y` in `graphConf.js` (by default `graphexpx` and `graphexpy`), to whatever keys are refering to the node positions in the graphDB. Values must be numbers. According to [Sim Bamford](https://github.com/bricaud/graphexp/pull/24), reasonable values should be below 500 to stay within the page limits. Node with predefined positions are not subject to the force layout and will stay at the same position, while the others may move. It may be useful for plotting a hierarchical graph for example.

## Program description

The program uses:
* the D3.js library to visualize a graph in an interactive manner, [API Reference](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md),
* an ajax request (with Jquery) that query the graph database (Gremlin Tinkerpop via REST).


## Contributing
Contribution as pull requests are very welcome.
If you want to contribute, you may have a look at the [issues](https://github.com/bricaud/graphexp/issues). You can also submit a pull request with a new feature. When contributing, keep in mind that graphexp must stays simple. The idea is to have a simple tool for a quick (and efficient) graph exploration.


## Tutorial with the tree of life
Once your gremlin server is up and running (from the [Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/bricaud/gremlin-server-with-demo-graph/)), click on the `get graph info` button. Information should appear on the left side of the page, like on the following image.
![graphexptol1](https://github.com/bricaud/graphexp/blob/master/images/graphexptol1.png "Graph exploration Tree of life")

This graph has a single type of nodes (label 'vertex') and a single type of edges (label 'edge'). Each node is a species (taxon) living on earth or extinct, and directed edges represent the link ancestor-descendant.
The different node properties are displayed on the left. 
* `CHILDCOUNT` the number of descendent nodes
* `name` the name of the species
* `HASPAGE` whether there is a page of information on the [Tree Of Life Project website](http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/downloadtree.html)
* `ID` Tree of Life Project unique id
* `CONFIDENCE` confidence in classification, from confident (0) to less confident (1) and (2)
* `EXTINCT` whether the node is extinct (2) or not (0)
* `LEAF` the node is a leaf of the tree (1) or the node does not represent a leaf (it has or will have descendent nodes on the Tree of Life) (0)
* `PHYLESIS` (0) monophyletic, (1) uncertain, (2) not monophyletic

On the top navigation bar, choose the field `name`, enter 'Dinosauria' as value in the input and click on the `Search` button. Do not forget the capital letter, as the search is case-sensitive. A single node, corresponding to the Dinosaurs clade, should appear in the middle of the page. Click on the node to display node details on the right as well as its ancestors and descendants on the graph. 
Check the box `name` on the left bar to display the node names.
You should see appearing the two subgroups of dinosaurs `Saurischia` and `Ornithischia`, as in the [Wikipedia dinosaur page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_classification) and an additional `none` node which is the ancestor. This latter node is a taxon that has ancestors and descendants but does not have a name. Note that there are different versions of the tree of life and it is always evolving as researchers find new species.
![graphexptol2](https://github.com/bricaud/graphexp/blob/master/images/graphexptol2.png "Graph exploration Tree of life")
You may now enjoy the exploration of the dinosaur order by clicking on nodes and following ascendant and descendant lines. The oldest nodes will vanish as you explore the data and if you want more nodes to be displayed, just increase the number of layers on the top navigation bar.

You may also color the nodes according to the values of some of their properties by clicking on the color tab on the left side. The color scale is computed using the range of values of the nodes already displayed and a palette of 20 colors. You should refresh the color after a few steps of exploration.

![graphexptol3](https://github.com/bricaud/graphexp/blob/master/images/graphexptol3.png "Graph exploration Tree of life")

During the exploration of the `Dinosauria` clade you may find the [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird) class `Aves`. They are the only survivors of the Dinosaur group and descendant of dinosaurs with feathers. To see it, enter `Aves` in the value field, press search and climb up the tree.

If you want to explore the world of insects, you may start with the taxon `Insecta` and follow the links. Did you know that spiders are not insects but have they own group `Arachnida`? Can you tell what is the common ancestor between spiders and insects? 

You may also be interested in the `Homo` group. 

Have a try on the live demo of Graphexp on the [project Github page](https://bricaud.github.io/graphexp/).
